# Graphene-ML Example

This example demonstrates how to use `mlsolve.py` to perform a geometry optimization on a graphene structure with a defect using the MACE model.

## Running the Example

To run this example, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 mlsolve.py -i ml_input.py -g graphene4x4withdefect.cif
```
